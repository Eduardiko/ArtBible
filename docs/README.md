# Introduction: What are they?
The Art Bible (or Style Guide) are one of the many game design documents useful for game designers to convey and communicate their ideas to the members of the team. It's a communication tool used as a reference document or guideline created on the early phases of a project (shortly after the GDD) by the art director, the one who knows the details of what the game is going to look and feel from an artistic point of view and has a clear vision of the game's visuals.

## Main Usage:
Art bibles serve two main functions inside a project:
- Communication
  - Tell about how the game will look like (and the reasons behind it)
  - Help the art department understand the art direction
  - Allow new members to be up to date with the team
  - **Marketing!**
- Memory Aid
  - Reference to consult for details about the project
  - Maintain consistency through all the production process
  - Keep cohesion between all the members

However, it should not be used as the only tool given to artists to produce the game's art, but rather a quick reference guide used to show the main ideas and concepts artists should use to produce art; and the layout of more technical details such as camera placement or UI.

# Market Study: Items commonly found inside Art Bibles

Depending on the magnitude and level of depth of the art direction, the number of elements and the amount of detail dedicated to such may vary. Here's some examples:

However, in most documents, the pages to be found can be categorized in different parts:
## Main points
### Art Style
This is _**vital**_ for the understanding of the game's most important feelings players should have while playing and what the main direction of the project will be focused on. It will define the game's main points that should be consistent around all its elements and how . This may include:
- Graphic style:
  - 2D/2.5D/3D
  - Realistic
  - Stylized
  - Cartoon
  - PixelArt
- Time Period
- Atmosphere
  - Humoristic setting in a dark environment?
  - Dark undertones in a seemingly peaceful place?
  - A tragic retelling of a war?
- Shapes
- Materials & Textures

The choices made here will determine how the game will look in the end,

## Advice on creating a good Art Bible
Some of the questions art directors ask themselves in order to create a good document could be:
- Who is this document targeted to?
- How can I convey the most important information efficiently for new members?
- What may attract sponsors or producers?
- What resources can I use to make all artists understand and share the same visual intents?
