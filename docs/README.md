# Introduction: What are they?
The Art Bible are one of the many game design documents useful for game designers to convey and communicate their ideas to the members of the team. It's a tool used as a reference document or guide created on the early phases of a project by the art director, the one who knows the details of what the game is going to look and feel from an artistic point of view and has a clear vision of the game's visuals.
